===================================================
DESCRIPTION:
+ GPRsim.c
+ This General Purpose Register machine simulator takes a binary-encoded program with text and data components and stores them into a main memory. Calling each instruction one at a time, it executes the program, which in this case solves whether a word is a palindrome or not.

===================================================
COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS:
+ Change directory to file location |	cd group24_project2
+ Compile using gcc		    |	gcc GPRSim.c -g

===================================================
HOW TO USE:
+ Compile using instructions above
+ Run the default output program    |	./a.out
+ Enter the file name (palindrome.s)|	Enter a file name: palindrome.s
+ Enter a word to check		    |	Enter a word: racecar
+ Results will be printed

===================================================
DESIGN ISSUES:
+ How to display label on binary file:
	-(SLN) Have a flag opcode that specifically points to labels, 		and map them at a compiler level in memory.
+ How to have variable instruction length:
	-(SLN) Use opcode flag's to decide what type of instruction is 
	being used.
