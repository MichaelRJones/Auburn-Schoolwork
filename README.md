Four projects from Computer Architecture 

These four projects are a series of processor simulations using different techniques of interpreting instructions through 
various architectures. Each reads in a pseudo binary encoded file and take specific instructions. Every project has its own
README with additional information. The projects progress in complexity.

Project 1: Stack Architecure / Accumulator Architecture
Project 2: General Purpose Register Architecture
Project 3: Simple Pipeline Architecture
Project 4: Scoreboard Architecture
