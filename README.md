Four projects from Computer Architecture 

These four projects are a series of processor simulations using different techniques of interpreting binary instructions through
various architectures. Each takes a pseudo binary encoded file and executes specific instructions. Each project folder has its own README with additional information. The projects progress in complexity.


Project 1: Stack Architecure / Accumulator Architecture

Project 2: General Purpose Register Architecture

Project 3: Simple Pipeline Architecture

Project 4: Scoreboard Architecture
